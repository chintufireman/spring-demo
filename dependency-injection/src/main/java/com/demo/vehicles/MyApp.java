//		1. now if u want Bus mileage then u have to change
//		from car to bus class by changing class name
		
//		2. the thing which we are noticing here is currently u are
//		car but if u want bus then u have to initialize object
//		with bus by changing the Code.
//		
//		3. this thing is not much tedious because there is only
//		two object in which we are deciding how Vehicle should
//		behave now imagine u had 100 implementations. u wont be 
//		able to change so much.
//		
//		4. that's why the job of spring framework is that 
//		if there is any object and u have to make it configurable
//		then u will take help of spring instead of changing code
//		everytime
